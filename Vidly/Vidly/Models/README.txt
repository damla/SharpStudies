*Firstly we created a movie class in Models file.
	->Created id and name properties.
*After that, created a controller under controllers(Denetleyici) file.
	->We created mvc empty because we will create the controller from scratch. {MoviesController}
	->Changed index method as random.
	->Added new var named movie and added "shrek!" as name.
*Now, we need to add Random's view into Views/Movies.
